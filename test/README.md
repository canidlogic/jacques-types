Contains scripts for testing Jacques-Types.

To work properly, these scripts and HTML forms must be in the same directory on a server, and the `jcqtypes.php` file must also be in this directory.

The `test_text_form.html` page allows for Unicode string testing, which uses `test_text_submit.php` for processing.

The `test_types_forms.html` page allows for testing the other types, which uses `test_types_submit.php` for processing.
